My room renovation plan
1.	Visit to the store
I will go to the store to choose matching furniture and wall colors. I will also pay attention to the lighting in my room because I would like to change it.
2.	Preparing room for painting.
I will start preparing the room by taking out the old furniture and carpet. Then I will dismantle the curtains, chandelier and electronics screwed to the walls.
3.	Painting
Painting will begin by protecting the floor so that the paint does not stain it. I will paint the ceiling first, then I will start painting the walls.
4.	Furniture
After painting, I will clean the entire room to prepare it for the arrival of new furniture. After assembling the desk and wardrobe, I will arrange and level them. The last to arrive is the bed with a desk chair, setting them up is a formality.
5.	Decoration
At the end, I will buy a carpet, flowers for the room and install the room lighting, electronic equipment (TV, computer, sound system).
